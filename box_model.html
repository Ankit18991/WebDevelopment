                    The Faculty May seem to be the Best In the Beginning Because of the appearance that they make. And also, when You take admission in this college, there is also a change in the starting few weeks of the college session thst you may realise that it was mistake to take admission in this college and just leave. So they Maintain a good repo and Good appearance just ot show you how desciplined they are, but trust me they are not. It is not my political agenda, it is just my experience as the alumini of this college. After a few weeks, this coollge treats you like prisoner and there will be no one to blame to except Yourself. All they want from you is money, money and money. And the quality of teachers is just phenomenal, like literally. They are just time waster. In the very frist sem, you will get tyeachers like Suket Jha, who just watches the train passing by and watches the fcucking time. He has remembered the time and the day of passing of the train accross the track nearby. ONLY ONE Faculty NAMED <strong>Shivkant Kumar</strong> is the best.

                    Students are mere objects to this College. Being an autonomous college, they think they are above the law and the government. And they exploit the students and torture them mentally for doing the right thing.

                    Just go to this Website of the college Just to Understand the hypocrisy this college shows on the Website.

                    A piece of advice, don't fall for these exploiting colleges , even though the college has NAAC credibility of B++, they still are worse then the kindergraden Government school in every village of this country.

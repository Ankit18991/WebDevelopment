    NOTES:-
        1. To use chrome development tools, we should go to the website, and right click on the element You want to edit. Go to 'inspect' and then choose the portion and right click on the portion. And choose 'edit in HTML' from the 'element' column of the 'inspect' mini tab that opened. And customize it for Yourself the way You want to.

        (or Look at the top left corner of the mini ab opened and click on the leftmost button to select a section from Our Webpage, {to select an element to inpect it})

        2. If we defined a class In the the '.css' file, and the class is not present in any of the lement of the HTML file, we can go the live server porm(our run time web page) and right click on the file and choose 'inspect' and then choose a section . Then right click on the 'elements' column of the 'inspect' and select 'edit in HTML'.

        Then You can Just add an element and define the class name in the HTML file, but remember that it won't be a permanenet change , until you change your HTML file(Add that class in an element defined in the Original HTML file).

                    To position the youth to reap the benefits of the rapidly changing economic environment and the
                    growing industrialization, the need for making available quality management education was felt by
                    Dr. Jagannath Mishra as early as in the year 1973. L.N.Mishra College of Business Management was
                    established by the Lalit Narayan Mishra College of Business Management, Muzaffarpur (a society
                    registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 and headed by Dr. Jagannath Mishra) to
                    accomplish the shared vision of Late Lalit Narayan Mishra, the former Union Minister of Railway,
                    Government of India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The College was inaugurated on February 11, 1974 by His Excellency Shri R.D.Bhandare, the then
                    Governor of Bihar. Keeping in view the excellent performance of the College in all aspects, the
                    State Government and the University Grants Commission conferred the College an ‘autonomous’ status
                    in the year 1985 on the recommendations of the parent University. Consequent upon being granted the
                    ‘autonomous status’ under Article 73 of Bihar Universities Act 1976 for the general and financial
                    administration of the College an empowered Committee was also set up. This Committee was subsumed in
                    the Governing Body of the Lalit Narayan Mishra College of Business Management, Muzaffarpur (the
                    Society). The Director of the College functions as the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of the College.

                    Director and having representatives of students and staff, has also been formed.

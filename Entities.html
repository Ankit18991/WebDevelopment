    NOTES:-
        1. <div class="container">
        <p>This is a Pragraph</p>
    </div>

        <div class="container">
            <p>This is another        paragraph</p>
        </div>

        Both will be printed the same. So, to use the blank spaces ,we use the HTML entities. Althugh not  recommeneded to use it in the proffessional websites.
